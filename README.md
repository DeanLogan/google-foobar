# google-foobar

Google foobar is a secret coding challange presented by Google to people who search for programming related questions or topics on Google. Foobar presents a series of coding challenges of increasing difficulty, covering various computer science concepts and problem-solving skills. It is designed to discover and recruit talented developers for potential job opportunities at Google. 

However this has been going on for a while so a lot of people see it more as just a cool easter egg on google now. If you want to find out more information about it here is a [medium article by Mohit Gupta](https://itsmohitt.medium.com/things-you-should-know-about-google-foobar-invitation-703a535bf30f) from 2018.

I was lucky enough for this invite to randomly pop-up for me one day which was a pretty cool experience :) this repo contains the problems I was given and my solutions for them. Each problem allows you to solve it in either python or java. For the submissions I choose python mainly because I'm more familiar with it but for this repo I have also completed the challanges in java using gradle as my build tool.
